    <h2>Waste Segregation Tips</h2>
    <p>Here are some useful tips to segregate your waste:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Biodegradable Waste:</strong> Includes food scraps, garden waste, and other organic matter. Always dispose of it in a compostable bag.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-biodegradable Waste:</strong> Includes plastics, metals, glass, and other materials that cannot be composted. Ensure they are cleaned and sorted for recycling.</li>
        <li><strong>Recyclable Materials:</strong> Items such as paper, cardboard, and plastics (check for recycling symbols) can be placed in the recycling bin.</li>
        <li><strong>Hazardous Waste:</strong> Batteries, e-waste, and chemicals should be disposed of separately in designated bins to prevent environmental damage.</li>
    </ul>
